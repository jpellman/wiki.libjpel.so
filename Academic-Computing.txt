== On Funding Models ==

Essentially, most academic software is either a) grant-funded in some way or b) created via some sort of consortium (i.e., the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_source|community source]] model).  Some software lives under an umbrella organization, such as the [[https://www.apereo.org/|Apereo Foundation]] or [[https://www.apache.org/foundation/|Apache Foundation]].
