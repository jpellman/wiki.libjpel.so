= Miscellaneous =

This page contains miscellaneous snippets that I pick up that I haven't been able to group into bigger concepts yet.

 * uniq -c : 'prefix lines by the number of occurrences'

 * In the sudoers file- ''#includedir'' is '''not''' a comment.  It's a directive that points to supplemental config files.  There are several other ''#include'' directives.  This mimics C syntax.

 * fail2ban - a great way to get rid of spammers / brute force attacks.  Thanks Yarik!
