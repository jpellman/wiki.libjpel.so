= Miscellaneous =

This page contains miscellaneous snippets that I pick up that I haven't been able to group into bigger concepts yet.

 * uniq -c : 'prefix lines by the number of occurrences'

 * In the sudoers file : ''#includedir'' is '''not''' a comment.  It's a directive that points to supplemental config files.  There are several other ''#include'' directives.  This mimics C syntax.

 * fail2ban : a great way to get rid of spammers / brute force attacks.  Thanks Yarik!

 * bash : &#91;&#91; ${var} =~ "foo" &#93;&#93; - check if a string contains a substring "foo"

 * If an AWS S3 upload is MultiPart, the ETag attribute of an S3 bucket object is *not* an MD5 hash.  It is the hashes for each part uploaded concatenated, plus a dash and the number of parts uploaded (see [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonResponseHeaders.html|here]]).

 * Display line numbers in vim : http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Display_line_numbers

 * Switch from less to vim- ':wv'.
 
 * Exec last command in bash *!!*.

 * Check before replacing in vim :s/foo/bar/gc'

 * Apparently the Java heap makes use of the RAM allocated for buffer/cache (so the buffer/cache isn't freed up).

 * [[ https://www.yourkit.com/docs/kb/sizes.jsp | Article on JVM Heap Size ]] & [[ https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html | Oracle Docs on JVM Heap ]]

 * An analogy: web/app servers / load balancers belong to the same sub-class of problems that HPC schedulers treat, but are just more narrow in scope.

 * HP iLO power button options: https://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/27971206/HP-iLO.html

 * A 301 redirect in nginx for HTTPS requires a cert because the packet needs to be decrypted for nginx to inspect the host field of the packet header.

 * git branch != git checkout for creating a new branch using the CLI.

 * [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection | Keep Alive Client ]]

 * Variable expansion doesn't work with watch.

 * [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science) | Fiber (specialized form of thread) ]]

 * [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization | CAA ]] (combines SSL/TLS certificate file w/ a DNS record to increase security)

 * The -c flag for du caches file size estimates so that they can be retrieve more quickly on future invocations?
 ( [[ http://www.linfo.org/du.html | More reading ]] in addition to the man file)

 * [[ http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/ | XKCD Password Generator ]]

 * [[ https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/ | Canned nginx Configs (to use as templates) ]]

 * Apparently KVM and Virtualbox are incompatible / can't be run simultaneously.  See [[ http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/kvm-virtualbox.html | here ]] for an idea on how to handle that.

 * Fast Boot as an issue with bootable thumb drives: https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/58001/#post-331378

 * Succinct overview of iptables: https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables

 * More readings of ZFS configurations: https://calomel.org/zfs_raid_speed_capacity.html , https://www.delphix.com/blog/delphix-engineering/zfs-raidz-stripe-width-or-how-i-learned-stop-worrying-and-love-raidz

 * cat /dev/null > /path/to/log allows you to wipe a log without restarting any associated process / daemon

 * When a user is encountering timeout errors with SSH: https://www.bjornjohansen.no/ssh-timeout

 * strace references:

  * http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2009/105/Practical-strace

 * gpasswd - it exists ; it is a good way to remove users from groups etc
