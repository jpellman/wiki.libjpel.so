= Miscellaneous =

This page contains miscellaneous snippets that I pick up that I haven't been able to group into bigger concepts yet.

 * uniq -c : 'prefix lines by the number of occurrences'

 * In the sudoers file : ''#includedir'' is '''not''' a comment.  It's a directive that points to supplemental config files.  There are several other ''#include'' directives.  This mimics C syntax.

 * fail2ban : a great way to get rid of spammers / brute force attacks.  Thanks Yarik!

 * bash : &#91;&#91; ${var} =~ "foo" &#93;&#93; - check if a string contains a substring "foo"

 * If an AWS S3 upload is MultiPart, the ETag attribute of an S3 bucket object is *not* an MD5 hash.  It is the hashes for each part uploaded concatenated, plus a dash and the number of parts uploaded (see [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonResponseHeaders.html|here]]).

 * Display line numbers in vim : http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Display_line_numbers

 * Switch from less to vim- ':wv'.
 
 * Exec last command in bash *!!*.

 * Check before replacing in vim :s/foo/bar/gc'

 * Apparently the Java heap makes use of the RAM allocated for buffer/cache (so the buffer/cache isn't freed up).

 * [[ https://www.yourkit.com/docs/kb/sizes.jsp | Article on JVM Heap Size ]] & [[ https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html | Oracle Docs on JVM Heap ]]

 * An analogy: web/app servers / load balancers belong to the same sub-class of problems that HPC schedulers treat, but are just more narrow in scope.

 * HP iLO power button options: https://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/27971206/HP-iLO.html
