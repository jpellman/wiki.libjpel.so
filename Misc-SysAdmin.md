Miscellaneous
=============

This page contains miscellaneous snippets that I pick up that I haven't been able to group into bigger concepts yet.

-   In the sudoers file : *\#includedir* is **not** a comment. It's a directive that points to supplemental config files. There are several other *\#include* directives. This mimics C syntax.
-   fail2ban : a great way to get rid of spammer brute force attacks. Thanks Yarik!
-   HP iLO power button options: <http/www.experts-exchange.cquestio279712HP-iLO.html>
-   git branch != git checkout for creating a new branch using the CLI.
-   [Fiber (specialized form of thread)](http/en.wikipedia.owiFiber_(computer_science))
-   cadnull \palog allows you to wipe a log without restarting any associated proces daemon
-   ZeroMQ references:
    -   <htt/nichol.zeromq-an-introduction>
    -   <htt/intothesaltmine.readthedocs.latechaptecommand-and-contrzeromq.html>
    -   <http/news.ycombinator.citem?id=2428004>
-   gpasswd - it exists ; it is a good way to remove users from groups etc
-   [modules](http/docs.saltstack.clatesalt-modindex.html) are often more useful than grains in getting system info in sal just because a grain doesn't exist, doesn't mean there isn't an easy way to get it that's not cmd.run
