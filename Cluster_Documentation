Section 3: Topology
#################################

Hugo, Voltaire, Montaigne and Cervantes are connected to a 6 port hub, with 4 ports used.  1 port is broken.  The last port is an unused uplink port.
All nodes can connect to each other.  Cervantes can connect outside of the LAN using Wifi, and is thus used as a means of downloading packages from the Canonical repos.  Cervantes has a user (installuser) whose home directory is mounted as an nfs partition on the other nodes- this user's home directory contains .deb files and a Packages.gz file.
#################################

Section 4: Users
#################################
Hugo (head node):
	-jpellman
	-mpiuser (home folder is nfs mount; hugo is nfs server), uid=999
	-installuser (home folder is nfs mount; fstab modified), uid=998

Voltaire:
	-jpellman
	-mpiuser (home folder is nfs mount; fstab modified), uid=999
	-installuser (home folder is nfs mount; fstab modified), uid=998

Montaigne:
	-jpellman
	-mpiuser (home folder is nfs mount; fstab modified), uid=999
	-installuser (home folder is nfs mount; fstab modified), uid=998

Cervantes:
	-jpellman
	-mpiuser (home folder is nfs mount; fstab modified), uid=999
	-installuser (home folder is nfs mount; cervantes is nfs server), uid=998

TODO: Install SLURM.  Configure SLURM on all nodes. Complication: Version of SLURM installed on Cervantes and Hugo is 64-bit.  Will need to recompile SLURM for 32-bit if possible.
