= Neuroinformatics Pipelines =

A page to store links to documentation for common bits of software, and take notes on steps that overlap.  I think that, by and large, the majority of neuroscience problems fall into three categories: image manipulation, quantifying behavioral observations, and stimulus presentation.

== Image Manipulation ==

These utilities ultimately should amount to specialized versions of Photoshop/the GIMP that operate in 3D space rather than 2D.  Some of them include some statistical processing tools as well.  Essentially these then become hybridized versions of Photoshop and R/Stata/SPSS/SAS.
