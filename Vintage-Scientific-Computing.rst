Vintage Scientific Computing
============================

I'm using this page to track pages related to the intersection of two of my interests: scientific computing and retrocomputing.  Together, these interests make a pretty niche topic

MATLAB
------

Here are some posts on the history of MATLAB from the official MathWorks_ blog:

* `Wilkinson and Reinsch Handbook on Linear Algebra`_

* `LINPACK, Linear Equation Package`_

* `EISPACK, Matrix Eigensystem Routines`_

* `MATLAB History, PC-MATLAB Version 1.0`_

* `Modern MATLAB, part 1`_

* `Modern MATLAB, part 2`_

* `The MATLAB Technical Computing Environment`_

SAS
---

* `SAS Institute/FDA Intellectual Partnership for Efficient Regulated Research Data Archival and Analyses`_

* `Selection from "Strength in Numbers: The Rising of Academic Statistics Departments in the U. S."`_

* `SAS grows from an on-campus project to an independent company`_ (oral history)

* `Anthony Barr's SAS History`_

* `SAS: A hard-to-define product but simple success`_
