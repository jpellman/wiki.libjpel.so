Description
-----------

My router does not have a cute name.  It is a WNR3500Lv2_.  It's connected to the interwebz via my ArrisSurfboard_ cable modem.  The most notable thing about this router is that I've installed dd-wrt_ on it.  This means that, in addition to providing me with wonderful streaming movies, e-mails, games and other web goodness it provides:

* Static allocation for addresses using DHCP

* Custom DNS entries between local IPs and domains (currently using the .so TLD because I like it and no one else really uses it) provided by [[|http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.htmlDNSMasq]].

* VPN to my apartment via `OpenVPN Server`_

Configuration Backup
--------------------

I've exported a copy of my configuration and put it at */home/jpellman/Documents/Backups* on maxwell_.  This configuration changes infrequently enough that I plan on backing it up on an ad-hoc basis after major changes are made.

Plans
-----

I don't have any major plans at the moment because I'm boring like that.
