 * [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435773/|Connectome Networks: From Cells to Systems]] - offers a taxonomy for the scales of imaging.  At a glance (I haven't really read it yet as of 1/7/19), it looks like you could combine different factors at different levels of analysis as part of a useful nested hierarchical schema (e.g., microscale neurovascular coupling and microscale action potentials are components of macroscale fMRI and EEG readings).
