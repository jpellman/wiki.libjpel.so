== man, whatis, apropos ==

 * man ''commandname'' : returns a manual (which you can read using vim navigation keys) for ''commandname''
 * Several different manual pages may exist for a given command.
 * whatis ''commandname'' : lists all the man pages for ''commandname''
 * apropos ''searchstring'' : allows you to search for a command name that you might not know in full.
 * Manual pages are added when a package is installed.
 * A manual index database is updated once a day by a cronjob ('''/etc/cron.daily/man-db.cron''').  This is used by ''whatis'' and ''apropos'' (see below).
 * To update the index database manually (ha) type ''mandb''. 

== info ==

 * Because Richard Stallman is a dirty hippy, there are also Texinfo pages.  These might go into more detail than man pages.
 * info ''commandname'' : returns a Texinfo manual for ''commandname''.
 * ls /usr/share/info : You can see all the installed Texinfo manuals by looking inside '''/usr/share/info'''

== /usr/share/doc ==
 
 * #TODO
