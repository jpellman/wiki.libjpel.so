= The libjpel.so Wiki =

This is the personal Wiki of John Pellman.  He is mostly using this as a palimpsest for snippets of information he gleans (primarily links to good articles) and various notes related to his interests.  The main role that he envisions for this wiki is to aid him in remembering what he learns by acting as a canvas to organize his thoughts.  This is helpful because [[Memory | elaborative processing increases recall]].  Aside from technical notes, he hopes that he'll have some time for a little science as well.  He also is using this as a location to document his home IT infrastructure, and plan for ways to improve it.
