MATLAB
======

I don't particularly like MATLAB. Licensing is always a pain and it seems like there's very little that it can do that SciPy/NumPy/Pandas can't do better at this point. It's great for checking your work if you're taking a linear algebra course though. This page is used to track like-minded opinions, as well as to track methods for weening researchers off of it and onto scientific Python, which currently seems to be the best supported alternative ([Julia](https://julialang.org/) seems to suffer from being overly ambitious in its scope, and doesn't seem to have gained widespread adoption).
