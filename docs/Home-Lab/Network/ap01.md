Description
-----------

ap01 (shorthand for "Access Point 1") is an [ASUS N300 RT-N12_D1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DWFPDNO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with stock firmware installed.  It's currently set up to function as access point only (this functionality is built into the stock firmware).  Routing functionality is provided by [gateway01](gateway01.md).

Configuration Backup
--------------------

I have not yet backed up the configuration for this.  After I create a dedicated backup machine I'll stash a backup there.

Plans
-----

 * I need to get a wall mount and put this on top of it to see if that provides better coverage.  I've been looking at [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2IQSXF/?coliid=I3MFIPQIPXV8OX&colid=38S74L174KYDO&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) for both this and [ap02](ap02.md).
 * Maybe I'll install dd-wrt on it?  This is possible according to [here](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Asus_RT-N12).  Not sure if it's particularly worthwhile though.
