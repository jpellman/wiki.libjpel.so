ap02
=====

Description
-----------

ap02 (shorthand for "Access Point 2") is a [WNR3500Lv2](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RYYZZS/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with [dd-wrt](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WNR3500L) on it.  It's currently set up to function as a wireless repeater because my main WAP ([ap01](ap01)) does not always provide reliable coverage in my bedroom.  Instructions for this particular setup can be found [here](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Repeater_Bridge#Instructions).

Configuration Backup

I have not yet backed up the configuration for this.  After I create a dedicated backup machine I'll stash a backup there.

Plans
-----

 * I need to get a wall mount and put this on top of it to see if that provides better coverage in my bedroom.  I've been looking at [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2IQSXF/?coliid=I3MFIPQIPXV8OX&colid=38S74L174KYDO&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) for both this and [ap01](ap01.md).
 * This build of dd-wrt is ancient and [Kong is no longer making builds](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDWRT/comments/d425o2/rip_kong_ddwrt/) so I'm never going to hook this up directly to a modem again.  It will live on only behind a firewall appliance (i.e., [gateway01](gateway01.md)).
