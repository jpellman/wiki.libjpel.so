Major Past Academic Computing Initiatives of Note
-------------------------------------------------

* `Andrew Project`_ (also here_ and `here <https://www.openafs.org/>`__)

* `Project Athena`_ (also `here <http://ist.mit.edu/athena>`__)

* `Stanford University Network`_ whose efforts, alongside the `Computer Systems Research Group`_ (BSD folks), were successfully transitioned into and continued with `Sun Microsystems`_

* sudo_ was made at SUNY Buffalo in the early to mid 80s.

* `The Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project`_ effectively morphed into Google

* Kermit_ (Columbia site `here <http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/>`__)

* Pamacea_ (also see general `Columbia AcIS UnixDev Projects`_)

* ITK_ / the Insight Software Consortium.  YouTube_ founder Jawed Karim was briefly involved in this.

* Mach_ (now part of OS X)

On Funding Models
-----------------

Essentially, most academic software is either a) grant-funded in some way or b) created via some sort of consortium (i.e., the `community source`_ model).  Some software lives under an umbrella organization, such as the `Apereo Foundation`_ or `Apache Foundation`_. 

Open Source / Community Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure`_ (Ford Foundation report on sustainability of open source model)

* `Community Source Is Dead`_

* `How to Achieve Vendor Lock-in with a Legit Open Source License – Affero GPL`_

* `Sakai: Building an Open Source Community`_

* `Cutting Edge: Collaboration gets the most out of software`_ (an article discussing the funding model for and history of the `SBGrid Consortium`_
