Bruno
=====

Description
-----------

Bruno is a Mid 2012, 13-inch MacBook_ Pro.  It is barely alive and is due to be replaced at some point in 2020.  I bought it refurbished around 1/1/15 and it is still kicking, but with caveats.  I mostly just use it for 2D gaming, simple web browsing, and as a dummy terminal to access Maxwell_, so I haven't been super bothered by its obvious deficiencies.

Bruno is named after `Giordano Bruno`_ (not to be confused with `Bruno Behard`_)

What's Broken
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Modern versions of OS X seem to assume that they're running on SSDs (`APFS definitely makes this assumption`_) and don't run well at all on mechanical disks.  To work around this, I switched out Bruno's spinny disk to an SSD.  Of course, this might just be because I've become so used to SSDs that I can't tolerate the slow speeds of spinny disks, although anecdotally_ some other people blame Apple as well.

* One of the RAM slots is bad (see here_ and `here <https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/4gu93k/starting_to_see_mid2012_13_macbook_pro_bottom_ram/>`__).  Essentially Apple used two different types of solder for the RAM banks and one of them is more liable to crap out.  As such I only use one RAM slot now, with half of the Macbook's original RAM (4 GB).  In theory I could purchase a single 8 GB SODIMM to fill in this one slot, but I've never felt it to be particularly worth it / performance with 4 GB RAM has been good enough for my purposes (90% of the gaming I do involves 2D graphics only).

* The battery has been demanding that I get it serviced for a while now.  I doubt it would retain charge for more than an hour (possibly 2 hours at best).  Recently (as of 1/11/2020) I opened it up and it was convinced that it had no charge.  I powered it down, waited several hours, and then it decided it had 80% charge.  Not really an auspicious sign.

Plans
-----

I'll probably replace this with a Macbook Air.  I've toyed around with just using a tablet (e.g., iPad, Surface) in the past, but due to the amount of multimedia work I do as I digitize documents and other media in my childhood home, I think that I'll still need a portable computer with a modest amount of horsepower.
