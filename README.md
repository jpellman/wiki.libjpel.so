# README

As of February, 11th 2024, I've decided to stop updating my publicly available "wiki" (which was a [MoinMoin](https://moinmo.in/) instance in its original incarnation but now is a static site built by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)).

I've switched to managing my notes privately with [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) and don't really feel a particularly strong need/desire to broadcast the (mostly boring) details of my professional/personal life.

If I feel that I have something particularly interesting to say that should be released to the public sphere, I'll export some Markdown from Joplin, tweak it, and publish it as a blog post.
