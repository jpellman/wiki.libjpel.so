I'm putting various links to project management resources here to synthesize how they may be tied to science.

* `Management for Scientists by Addgene`_

* `Project Management by Nick Jenkinson`_

* `Project Management for Scientists`_

* `Social Loafing`_

* `Mythical Man Month`_

* `Amdahl's law`_

* `Gustafson's law`_

* `W Edwards Deming`_

* `Herbert Simon`_

Examples of Project Management failures in science/basic research:

* `Charles Babbage's Difference Engine`_

* Hooke

Other Pitfalls:

* Taylorism_ - Don't want to squash creativity.

* Micromanagement example: guy who almost derailed LIGO

Advice:

* `How to start a lab by Tim Behrens`_
