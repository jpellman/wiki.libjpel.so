Memory
======

Memory is an inherently distributed process.  The role of the hippocampus, which traditionally was viewed as a centralized store, is more that of an integrator/synthesizer that brings together disparate fragments of experience.  Memories are reconstructions rather than recordings.  Memories can be strongly encoded in one modality (auditory, tactile, etc) but more weakly encoded in others.  Our ability to recall events is heavily dependent upon contextual cues.  The following notes may be inconsistent with what is stated in the literature, as they are an interpretation.

Implicit vs Explicit Memories
-----------------------------

* Implicit : Subconsciously-recalled memories that can still have an effect on how we behave.  These are memories in their 'raw' state, before being integrated by the hippocampus.  They are at least partially traceable to cortical regions.  Implicit memories can be seen in word completion studies of amnesiacs.

* Procedural : A sub-class of implicit memory.  Memories for how to perform a task.  Procedural memories are quite often encoded at the level of the basal ganglia / cerebellum.

* Explicit : Consciously-recalled memories.  Our experience of explicit memories is a result of the hippocampus synthesizing together our implicit memories.

Priming
-------

* Perceiving something in the environment can cause low-level activation of an implicit memory.  This can increase the probability that that memory will later be integrated by the hippocampus into conscious experience.  It can also influence reasoning/problem-solving on a subconscious level.

* Trying to recall something without any cues (free recall) is much much harder than cued-recall.
