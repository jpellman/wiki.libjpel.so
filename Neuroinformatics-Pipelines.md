Neuroinformatics Pipelines
==========================

A page to store links to documentation for common bits of software, and take notes on steps that overlap. I think that, by and large, the majority of neuroscience problems fall into three categories: image manipulation, quantifying behavioral observations, and stimulus presentation.

Image Manipulation
------------------

These utilities ultimately should amount to specialized versions of Photoshop/the GIMP that operate in 3D space rather than 2D. Some of them include some statistical processing tools as well. Essentially these then become hybridized versions of Photoshop and R/Stata/SPSS/SAS.

-   [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/spm12_manual.pdf)
-   [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/)

-   [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/)
-   [BrainVoyager](http://www.brainvoyager.com/bvqx/doc/UsersGuide/BrainVoyagerQXUsersGuide.html)

As per earlier statements, compare these manuals to:

-   [The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/docs/)
-   [Adobe Photoshop](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/user-guide.html)

Quantifying Behavioral Data
