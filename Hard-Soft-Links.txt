== Hard Links ==

 * ln /path/to/source /path/to/target
 * You cannot create a hard link pointing to a directory.
 * Only the owner of a file can make a hard link pointing to it in RHEL 7 (this contrasts with RHEL 6).
 * Hard links directly point to the inode for a file on disk.

== Soft/Symbolic Links ==

 * ln -s /path/to/source /path/to/target
 * Soft links can be to a directory.
 * Soft links create a new file that points to the source file.  This new file (the target) has its own inode.  Deleting a soft link will not delete the original file.
 * You can convert symlinks that use absolute paths to symlinks using relative paths with the ''symlinks -c'' command.  This can help when migrating symlinks across filesystems.

== Checking Links ==

 * ls -i /path/to/link : Prints the inode number of the file/directory.
