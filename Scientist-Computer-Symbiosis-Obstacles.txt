= Top Challenges in Facilitating Man-Computer Symbiosis in 2019 =

In 1960, J.C.R. Licklider identified the following as the greatest obstacles in facilitating human / computer interaction:

 1. A need for voice recognition.
 1. A need for GUIs (fulfilled at PARC) and tablet interfaces (fulfilled more recently with the smartphone revolution).
 1. A need for handwriting recognition- this need has become substantially less relevant, as most schoolchildren are taught to type in contemporary times (certainly not the case in my parents' generation), alternative Trie-based touch typing mechanisms are ubiquitous, and cursive is a dying art.
 1. Indelible memory.
 1. Some sort of workflow system (there was a passage where he anticipated Unix pipes).
 1. More elements I've forgotten.

Today, my completely ancedotal observation is that for human/computer symbiosis to be optimal, scientific researchers need:

 1. Consistent and intuitive packaging and reproducible environments.
 1. Scientific literature condensed into machine-parseable data that can be readily extracted (i.e., non-voice / handwriting related NLP).  Methods and results sections need to be easy to aggregate and evaluate at a glance- the excessive verbosity of most publications is a hindrance to scientific progress.
 1. Some sort of intuitive workflow system.
 1. Hardware-based accelerators (although this may be more of an optimization; see [[ASICS]]).
