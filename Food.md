I'm a big fan of the following kinds of tea:

### Sodas

-   Pacific (alcohol-free Pastis)

### Alcohol/Spirits

#### Good

-   Riesling White Wine
-   [McKenzie Whiskey](https://fingerlakesdistilling.com/our-products/whiskey/)
-   Laphroaig Whiskey
-   Pretty much anything from my home region or the Finger Lakes. I have no palate so I just choose based off geography and it generally works out well.
-   Pastis

#### Shitty
