A page where I keep my favorite recipes, and more broadly thoughts about food.

Recipes
-------

### Oat Milk

-   4 cups water
-   1/2 tsp guar gum
-   1 Tbsp creamer (or just dipotassium phosphate if available- this is preferable, but food-grade dipotassium phosphate is hard to come by outside of the commercial food industry)
-   3 Tbsp date syrup or 2 Tbsp molasses or 5g of sugar
