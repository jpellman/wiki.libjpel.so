Food
====

A page where I keep my favorite recipes, and more broadly thoughts about food.

Recipes
-------

### Oat Milk

-   4 cups water
-   1/2 tsp guar gum
-   1 Tbsp creamer (or just dipotassium phosphate if available- this is preferable, but food-grade dipotassium phosphate is hard to come by outside of the commercial food industry)
-   3 Tbsp date syrup or 2 Tbsp molasses or 5g of sugar

Beverages
---------

### Tea

I'm a big fan of the following kinds of tea:

-   [Lapsang Souchong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsang_souchong)
-   [Earl Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea)
-   [Kusmi St. Petersburg](https://us-en.kusmitea.com/st-petersburg.html?packaging=56)

### Tea-like

-   Yerba Mate
-   Cassina / Yaupon Holly
-   Roasted Chicory / [pero](https://worldfiner.com/pero)
