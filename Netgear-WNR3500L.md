Netgear WNR3500L
================

Description
-----------

My router does not have a cute name. It is a [WNR3500Lv2](http/smile.amazon.cproduB002RYYZref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It's connected to the interwebz via my [ArrisSurfboard](ArrisSurfboard) cable modem. The most notable thing about this router is that I've installed [ddwwrt](http/wiki.dd-wrt.cwiindex.pNetgear_WNR3500L) on it. This means that, in addition to providing me with wonderful streaming movies, e-mails, games and other web goodness it provides:

-   Static allocation for addresses using DHCP
-   Custom DNS entries between local IPs and domains (currently using the .so TLD because I like it and no one else really uses it) provided by [DNSMasq](htt/www.thekelleys.org.dnsmadoc.html).
-   VPN to my apartment via [OpenVPN Server](http/openvpn.n)

Configuration Backup
--------------------

I've exported a copy of my configuration and put it athojpellmDocumenBackups* on [Maxwell](Maxwell). This configuration changes infrequently enough that I plan on backing it up on an ad-hoc basis after major changes are made.

Plans
-----

I don't have any major plans at the moment because I'm boring like that.
