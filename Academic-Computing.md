Major Past Academic Computing Initiatives of Note
=================================================

-   [Andrew Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Project) (also [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100628060635/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/andrew/index.shtml) and [here](https://www.openafs.org/))
-   [Project Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena) (also [here](http://ist.mit.edu/athena))
-   [Stanford University Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_Network) whose efforts, alongside the [Computer Systems Research Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Systems_Research_Group) (BSD folks), were successfully transitioned into and continued with [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems)
-   [sudo](https://gratisoft.us/sudo/history.html) was made at SUNY Buffalo in the early to mid 80s.
-   [The Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project](https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100660) effectively morphed into Google (interestingly enough it looks like [Eolas](http://www.eolas.com/timeline.html) also was planning on submitting [a proposal](http://www.eolas.com/img/11-1-Hardin-letter94.pdf) for the same NSF initiative)
-   [Kermit](http://www.kermitproject.org/) (Columbia site [here](http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/))
-   [Pamacea](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/dev/projects/mod_auth_pamacea/) (also see general [Columbia AcIS UnixDev Projects](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/dev/unixdev/projects/))
-   [ITK](https://itk.org/ITK/project/about.html) / the Insight Software Consortium. [YouTube](../YouTube) founder Jawed Karim was briefly involved in this.
-   [Mach](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html) (now part of OS X)
-   Python was created first at [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/) and then continued to be developed at [CNRI](https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/)
-   EISPACK was created at Argonne National Laboratory and funded by the NSF and the US Atomic Energy Commission. LINPACK was developed at three universities (UCSD, University of New Mexico, and University of Maryland) and Argonne National Laboratory under NSF grant MCS76-03297.

On Technology Transfer
======================

-   [In which CCNMTL/CTL briefly talks about Bayh-Dole](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/rcr/rcr_data/foundation/index.html#2_B)
-   [Consequences of the Bayh-Dole Act](http://web.mit.edu/lawclub/www/Bayh-Dole%20Act.pdf)

On Funding Models
=================

Essentially, most academic software is either a) grant-funded in some way or b) created via some sort of consortium (i.e., the [community source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_source) model). Some software lives under an umbrella organization, such as the [Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/) or [Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/).

Open Source / Community Source
------------------------------

-   [Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure](https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/2976/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf) (Ford Foundation report on sustainability of open source model)
-   [Community Source Is Dead](http://mfeldstein.com/community-source-dead/)
-   [How to Achieve Vendor Lock-in with a Legit Open Source License â€“ Affero GPL](http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/2014/09/how-to-achieve-vendor-lock-in-with-a-legit-open-source-license-affero-gpl/)
-   [Sakai: Building an Open Source Community](http://www.dr-chuck.com/sakai-book/)
-   [Cutting Edge: Collaboration gets the most out of software](https://elifesciences.org/articles/01456) (an article discussing the funding model for and history of the [SBGrid Consortium](https://sbgrid.org/)
-   [Government Policy Towards Open Source Software](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1411617)
