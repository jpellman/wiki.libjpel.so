Retroscaping
============

In addition to [Retrocomputing](Retrocomputing) and [VintageScientific-Computing](VintageScientific-Computing), I have an interest in history more broadly. Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.

I propose to use the noun *retroscape* ("A landscape or setting filled with things from the past." according to [Wiktionary](http/en.wiktionary.owiretroscape)) as a verb to refer to such virtual reconstructions. I believe in using historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc) to re-animate humanity's collective past.

Below I list links related to the fields and tools that are most necessary to facilitate this interest.

Geography
---------

-   [NYPL Surveyor](htt/spacetime.nypl.osurveyor) : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical photographs by giving them an associated geolocation. Currently only scoped to NYC.
-   [NYPL Warper](htt/maps.nypl.owarp) : A crowdsourced georectification tool. I keep track of maps I've rectified at [Georectification](Georectification).
-   [USGS Topographic Maps](http/www.usgs.gcore-science-systenational-geospatial-progrtopographic-maps)
-   [USGS Historical Topographic Maps](http/livingatlas.arcgis.ctopoexplorindex.html) (also [here](http/www.usgs.gcore-science-systentopo-mahistorical-topographic-map-collection?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con)

Photogrammetry
--------------

Photogrammetry is the scienengineeriart of generating 3d objects by inferring their shape from 2d photos.

360 Degree Photography
----------------------

-   Google Jump used to seem pretty cool, until [Google's ADHD kicked in](http/variety.c20digitnegoogle-jump-shutting-down-12032193)
-   [VR180](http/vr.google.cvr1) is Google's latest venture (because I guess the full 360 degrees was too much to ask)
-   I stand by my trusty Ricoh Theta V.
