History
=======

In addition to [Retrocomputing](../Retrocomputing) and [VintageScientificComputing](../VintageScientificComputing), I have an interest in history more broadly. Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures. Below I list some fun resources related to this interest.

Geography
---------

-   [NYPL Surveyor](http://spacetime.nypl.org/surveyor) : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical locations by giving them an associated geolocation. Currently only scoped to NYC.
-   [NYPL Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/) : A crowdsourced georectification tool.
-   [80s.nyc](http://80s.nyc/)

Retroscaping
------------

According to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retroscape) the noun *retroscape* refers to:

    A landscape or setting filled with things from the past.

In the spirit of my opening remarks, I propose to use *retroscape* as a verb to refer to the recreation of a historical setting using virtual reality and historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc).
