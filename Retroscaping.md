Retroscaping
============

In addition to [Retrocomputing](../Retrocomputing) and [VintageScientificComputing](../VintageScientificComputing), I have an interest in history more broadly. Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.

I propose to use the noun *retroscape* ("A landscape or setting filled with things from the past." according to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retroscape)) as a verb to refer to such virtual reconstructions. I believe in using historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc) to re-animate humanity's collective past.

Below I list links related to the fields and tools that are most necessary to facilitate this interest.

Geography
---------

-   [NYPL Surveyor](http://spacetime.nypl.org/surveyor) : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical photographs by giving them an associated geolocation. Currently only scoped to NYC.
-   [NYPL Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/) : A crowdsourced georectification tool. I keep track of maps I've rectified at [Georectification](../Georectification).
-   [USGS Topographic Maps](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/topographic-maps)
-   [USGS Historical Topographic Maps](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/topoexplorer/index.html) (also [here](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/topo-maps/historical-topographic-map-collection?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con)

Photogrammetry
--------------

Photogrammetry is the science/engineering/art of generating 3d objects by inferring their shape from 2d photos.

Photography
-----------

-   NYPL Surveyor (see above)
-   [80s.nyc](http://80s.nyc/)
-   [Collection of Stereoscopic views](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/robert-n-dennis-collection-of-stereoscopic-views#/?tab=navigation)

360 Degree Photography
----------------------

-   Google Jump used to seem pretty cool, until [Google's ADHD kicked in](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/google-jump-shutting-down-1203219306/)
-   [VR180](https://vr.google.com/vr180/) is Google's latest venture (because I guess the full 360 degrees was too much to ask)
-   I stand by my trusty Ricoh Theta V.
