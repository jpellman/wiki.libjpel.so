History
=======

In addition to [Retrocomputing](../Retrocomputing) and [VintageScientificComputing](../VintageScientificComputing), I have an interest in history more broadly. Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures. Below I list some fun resources related to this interest.
