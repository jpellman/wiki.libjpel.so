= History =

In addition to [[Retrocomputing]] and VintageScientificComputing, I have an interest in history more broadly.  Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.  Below I list some fun resources related to this interest.
