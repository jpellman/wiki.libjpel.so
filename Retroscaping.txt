= Retroscaping =

In addition to [[Retrocomputing]] and VintageScientificComputing, I have an interest in history more broadly.  Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.  

I propose to use the noun ''retroscape'' ("A landscape or setting filled with things from the past." according to [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retroscape|Wiktionary]]) as a verb to refer to such virtual reconstructions. I believe in using historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc) to re-animate humanity's collective past.

Below I list links related to the fields and tools that are most necessary to facilitate this interest.

 * [[https://vr.google.com/vr180/|VR180]] is Google's latest venture (because I guess the full 360 degrees was too much to ask)
 * I stand by my trusty Ricoh Theta V.
