= History =

In addition to [[Retrocomputing]] and VintageScientificComputing, I have an interest in history more broadly.  Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.  Below I list some fun resources related to this interest.

== Geography ==

 * [[http://spacetime.nypl.org/surveyor|NYPL Surveyor]] : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical locations by giving them an associated geolocation.  Currently only scoped to NYC.
 * [[http://maps.nypl.org/warper/|NYPL Warper]] : A crowdsourced georectification tool.
 * [[http://80s.nyc/|80s.nyc]]

== Retroscaping ==

According to [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retroscape|Wiktionary]] the noun ''retroscape'' refers to:

{{{
A landscape or setting filled with things from the past. 
}}}

In the spirit of my opening remarks, I propose to use ''retroscape'' as a verb to refer to the recreation of a historical setting using virtual reality and historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc).
