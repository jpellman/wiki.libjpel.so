= A List of ASICs Used in Scientific Computing =

I'm using this page to track instances where scientific computing could make use of hardware acceleration (or other advantages) for specific applications.  Essentially, most of these technologies represent an instance where "old is new again" and the computing paradigms of the 40s-60s (where hardware was specialized and general purpose computing was not particularly commonplace) are back in vogue.
