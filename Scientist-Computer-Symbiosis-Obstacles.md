Top Challenges in Facilitating Man-Computer Symbiosis in 2019
=============================================================

In 1960, J.C.R. Licklider identified the following as the greatest obstacles in facilitating human / computer interaction (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-Computer_Symbiosis)):

1.  A need for voice recognition.
2.  A need for GUIs (fulfilled at PARC) and tablet interfaces (fulfilled more recently with the smartphone revolution).
3.  A need for handwriting recognition- this need has become substantially less relevant, as most schoolchildren are taught to type in contemporary times (certainly not the case in my parents' generation), alternative Trie-based touch typing mechanisms are ubiquitous, and cursive is a dying art.
4.  Indelible memory.
5.  Some sort of workflow system (there was a passage where he anticipated Unix pipes).
6.  More elements I've forgotten.

Essentially, Licklider thought that man-computer symbiosis would look something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIE8xk6Rl1w) (or [this full length version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjve67p33E)).

Today, my completely ancedotal observation is that for human/computer symbiosis to be optimal, scientific researchers need:

1.  Consistent and intuitive packaging and reproducible environments.
2.  Scientific literature condensed into machine-parseable data that can be readily extracted (i.e., non-voice / handwriting related NLP). Methods and results sections need to be easy to aggregate and evaluate at a glance- the excessive verbosity of most publications is a hindrance to scientific progress.
3.  Some sort of intuitive workflow system.
4.  Hardware-based accelerators (although this may be more of an optimization; see [ASICS](../ASICS)).
