Miscellaneous
=============

This page contains miscellaneous snippets that I pick up that I haven't been able to group into bigger concepts yet.

* uniq -c : 'prefix lines by the number of occurrences'

* In the sudoers file : *#includedir* is **not** a comment.  It's a directive that points to supplemental config files.  There are several other *#include* directives.  This mimics C syntax.

* fail2ban : a great way to get rid of spammers / brute force attacks.  Thanks Yarik!

* bash : .. raw:: html
     &#91;

  .. raw:: html
     &#91;

   ${var} =~ "foo" .. raw:: html
     &#93;

  .. raw:: html
     &#93;

   - check if a string contains a substring "foo"
