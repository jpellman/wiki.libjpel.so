Memory
======

Memory is an inherently distributed process. The role of the hippocampus, which traditionally was viewed as a centralized store, is more that of an integrator/synthesizer that brings together disparate fragments of experience. Memories are reconstructions rather than recordings. Memories can be strongly encoded in one modality (auditory, tactile, etc) but more weakly encoded in others. Our ability to recall events is heavily dependent upon contextual cues.

Procedural memories are quite often encoded at the level of the hippocampus for simple tasks (like riding a bike).
