= Roles in Science =

This is a rough list of the many roles I find people performing in scientific labs, many of which are informal due to the rigid, publish-or-perish mentality of academia.  In an ideal world, I would wish for these roles to be formally recognized so that individuals who want to pursue these roles may be seen as professionals in their own right (rather than an afterthought in the scientific process).  Perhaps, in an ideal world, research would be more of a "team sport", with researchers wearing fewer hats and spreading themselves less thin.
