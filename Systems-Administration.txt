= Systems Administration Notes =

This page stores both generic notes, as well as additional pages and categories related to systems administration.  My general modus operandi here is to start taking notes here, and then to break things out into separate pages when they get too large.

<<TableOfContents()>>

 * [[http://explainshell.com/|Explainshell]]
 * Exec last command in bash *!!*.
 * Variable expansion doesn't work with watch (8/10/19 - I'm not sure I believe this- I might just have been doing something with single quotes instead of double quotes)
 * The -c flag for du caches file size estimates so that they can be retrieve more quickly on future invocations?
 ( [[ http://www.linfo.org/du.html | More reading ]] in addition to the man file)
 * Type 'reset' when screen messes up your keyboard mapping.
 * uniq -c : 'prefix lines by the number of occurrences'

=== Memory ===
 
 * [[http://linuxatemyram.com|Linux Ate My RAM]]
 * Apparently the Java heap makes use of the RAM allocated for buffer/cache (so the buffer/cache isn't freed up).

== Applications ==

=== Web Servers ===

 * An analogy: web/app servers / load balancers belong to the same sub-class of problems that HPC schedulers treat, but are just more narrow in scope.
 * A 301 redirect in nginx for HTTPS requires a cert because the packet needs to be decrypted for nginx to inspect the host field of the packet header.
 * [[ https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/ | Canned nginx Configs (to use as templates) ]]

=== Databases ===

== Virtualization ==

 * Apparently KVM and Virtualbox are incompatible / can't be run simultaneously.  See [[ http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/kvm-virtualbox.html | here ]] for an idea on how to handle that (or just don't do that at all because it doesn't make too much sense to begin with- quoth the older and wiser me).
 * [[https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Networking|Xen Networking]]
 * [[https://wiki.hackzine.org/sysadmin/kvm-import-ova.html|Importing an OVA into KVM]]

== Cloud Computing ==

 * If an AWS S3 upload is MultiPart, the ETag attribute of an S3 bucket object is *not* an MD5 hash.  It is the hashes for each part uploaded concatenated, plus a dash and the number of parts uploaded (see [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonResponseHeaders.html|here]]).

=== S3-compatible object stores ===
