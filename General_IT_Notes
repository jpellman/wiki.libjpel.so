General Problem-Solving Algorithm:
1. Look for a past solution that can be re-applied or modified.  First look at solutions that I have already used.  If there is not a simple or elegant solution, do independent research (books, mailing lists, StackExchange) to see if others have devised a solution in the past that can be applied.
2. If step 1 fails, create some preliminary specifications for a solution.
3. Look for tools to implement the specifications.
4. Write pseudocode or make a flow chart to keep track of how components (functions, applications) might interact.
5. Document as you go along.
6. If the project is going to be long-term, set up a time table.

Lessons learned from working with non-standalone PsychoPy:
- Next time use a VM if you need to install deprecated or bleeding edge libraries on a system (i.e., 32-bit Python).
- Code reuse.
=================================================================
User-friendly Subversion clients:
Mac - svnX, SCPlugin
Windows - TortoiseSVN
=================================================================
Technology to become acquainted with:
-ACL permissions
=================================================================
scp -r dir1 user@server:dir2
-If dir2 does not exist, creates dir2 on server, populates with items within dir1.  Bref: files nested w/in dir2
-Else: If dir2 exists, copies dir1 into dir2 and nests it within dir2.  Bref dir1 nested w/in dir2.
=================================================================
chmod/permissions behavior:
-If you remove 'execute' from a directory, you will not be able to cd into it.
=================================================================
umask/permissions behavior:
- octal codes for umask are the inverse of chmod codes
=================================================================
grep:
	-F : returns lines with single occurrence of literal string (fgrep)
	-x : returns only if *the entire line* is an exact match for literal string
	-E : use extended regex (Perl style); no need for escapes to denote atoms (? review this) (egrep)
	* - returns lines with any number of consecutive repeats of search string
	. - wildcard character
=================================================================
. or SOURCE : 
Runs a script's commands through the current shell line by line.  The script's variables become available to the current shell environment.
