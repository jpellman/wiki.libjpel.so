This page contains notes from the MOOC [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/| Learning How to Learn]] on Coursera.  I expect there to be much overlap in scope and content between this and [[Memory]].

== Diffuse vs Focused Thinking ==
 * Focused thought is analogous to conscious, task-related thought.  Could also be analogous to Csikszentmihalyi's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)|flow]] or a telic/goal-oriented state.
 * Diffuse thought is analogous to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network|default mode network]].
 * Focused thought constricts our neural activity to very small, specific networks in the brain.  Diffuse thought allows activity to branch more readily from one network to a possibly unrelated one, such as synesthesia.
 * To learn a new skill or discipline, you need to balance diffuse and focused thought (similar to balancing exercise and resting).  Focused learning like a workout.

== Procrastination ==
 * Thoughts about a task can activate the insular cortex, leading to feelings of pain.  Do cope with this, people may switch to a more pleasurable activity.  However, if you just start the undesirable task the feelings of pain quickly taper off.  This is reminiscent of some aspects of avoidant behavior that might be treated by CBT.
 * Recommendation of time-boxing technique (Pomodoro).
