This page contains notes from the MOOC [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/| Learning How to Learn]] on Coursera.  I expect there to be much overlap in scope and content between this and [[Memory]].

== Week 1 ==

=== Diffuse vs Focused Thinking ===
 * Focused thought is analogous to conscious, task-related thought.  Could also be analogous to Csikszentmihalyi's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)|flow]] or a telic/goal-oriented state.
 * Diffuse thought is analogous to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network|default mode network]].
 * Focused thought constricts our neural activity to very small, specific networks in the brain.  Diffuse thought allows activity to branch more readily from one network to a possibly unrelated one, such as synesthesia.
 * To learn a new skill or discipline, you need to balance diffuse and focused thought (similar to balancing exercise and resting).  Focused learning like a workout.

=== Procrastination ===
 * Thoughts about a task can activate the insular cortex, leading to feelings of pain.  Do cope with this, people may switch to a more pleasurable activity.  However, if you just start the undesirable task the feelings of pain quickly taper off.  This is reminiscent of some aspects of avoidant behavior that might be treated by CBT.
 * Recommendation of time-boxing technique (Pomodoro).

=== Practice ===
 * Math might be more difficult to master because it involves more abstraction.
 * You want to strengthen neural connections through repetition- what fires together...
 * Importance of depth

=== Memory ===
 * Working memory based in prefrontal cortex.
 * Working memory doesn't hold 7 chunks, it holds 4 chunks.  No magic number 7.
 * Working memory is like a CPU cache- very small, only holds a little when closer to the core.
 * LTM like a warehouse, distributed over an area.  LTM is a NoSQL database?  Repetition of facts / procedures when learning is like a manual replication procedure sort of?
 * Spaced repetition is recommended.  Cramming is bad.

=== Sleep ===
 * Wakefulness state generates toxic byproducts in brain.  Brain cells (neurons? glia?) shrink during sleep, allowing toxins to be washed away.  Sleep as self-cleaning (Xie et al, 2013).
 * Coffee/caffeine then is not inherently bad in the short-term, but can prevent a necessary cleaning.
 * Sleep prunes unwanted info, strengthens wanted info (sort of like deduplication).
 * Sleep is diffuse mode / dmn on steroids; allows connections to be made that might not otherwise be made under the watchful eye of the prefrontal cortex.

=== Sejnowski Interview ===
 * Mental multi-tasking as context switching with a single core CPU (since most people aren't actually able to attend to multiple things at once).
 * An enriching environment (undergrad, companies with good culture- i.e., Bell Labs) leads to stronger connections in the hippocampus; impoverished environments (cubical farms, isolation) less so. 
 * In the absence of an enriching environment, exercise can increase neurons (i.e., increase BDNF)

== Week 2 ==

=== Chunking ===
 * Chunk: A set of relationships tying declarative facts together (like a graph).  A network of neurons that are strongly interconnected through repeated activation.  The cohesiveness of a chunk makes the individual facts it contains easier to remember.  Helps create a "big picture" rather than getting tunnel vision about individual facts.  A chunk is analogous to a simplified mental map (see [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MappersVsPackers|Mappers vs Packers]]; the folks on that Wiki aren't rigorous personality psychologists though so I take it with a grain of salt).
 * Stress diminishes our ability to form chunks via our working memory.
 * Chunking is a bit like compression.
 * Chunks as schemata?
