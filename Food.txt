A page where I keep my favorite recipes, and more broadly thoughts about food.

== Recipes ==

=== Oat Milk ===

 * 4 cups water
 * 1/2 tsp guar gum
 * 1 Tbsp creamer (or just dipotassium phosphate if available- this is preferable, but food-grade dipotassium phosphate is hard to come by outside of the commercial food industry)
 * 3 Tbsp date syrup or 2 Tbsp molasses or 5g of sugar

== Beverages ==

=== Tea ===

I'm a big fan of the following kinds of tea:
