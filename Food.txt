## page was renamed from Recipes
= Food =

A page where I keep my favorite recipes, and more broadly thoughts about food.

<<TableOfContents(2)>>

== Recipes ==

=== Oat Milk ===

 * 4 cups water
 * 1/2 tsp guar gum
 * 1 Tbsp creamer (or just dipotassium phosphate if available- this is preferable, but food-grade dipotassium phosphate is hard to come by outside of the commercial food industry)
 * 3 Tbsp date syrup or 2 Tbsp molasses or 5g of sugar

== Beverages ==

=== Tea ===

I'm a big fan of the following kinds of tea:

 * Pacific (alcohol-free Pastis)
 * Basically anything that tastes vaguely medicinal

=== Alcohol/Spirits ===

==== Good ====

 * Riesling White Wine
 * [[https://fingerlakesdistilling.com/our-products/whiskey/|McKenzie Whiskey]]
 * Laphroaig Whiskey
 * Pretty much anything from my home region or the Finger Lakes.  I have no palate so I just choose based off geography and it generally works out well.
 * Pastis

==== Shitty ====

 * Utica Club
 * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi%C5%9Bni%C3%B3wka_(liqueur)|Wiśniówka]]
