== Recipes ==

=== Oat Milk ===

 * 1 cup oats
 * 4 cups water
 * 1/4 tsp guar gum
 * 1/4 tsp Calcium Carbonate (should be around 1250mg Calcium)
 * 1 tsp sugar
 * 1/4 tsp salt

Soak 1 cup oats in disposable water for 15 minutes.  Drain out disposable water.  Add in 4 cups of water.  Blend for 30 seconds.  Filter out oats with nut milk bag / cheesecloth.  Add salt, guar gum, sugar and calcium carbonate.  Blend again.

=== General Tso's Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) ===
  
  * 1/2 cup TVP
  * 2 2/3 Tbsp sugar
  * 1 1/3 Tbsp [[https://smile.amazon.com/Sunbird-General-Chicken-Seasoning-Packet/dp/B00HVS31DC?sa-no-redirect=1|General Tso's seasoning packet]] or 1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp ginger + 1/2 tsp red pepper
  * 2 tsp methylcellulose HV
  * 1 tsp transglutaminase (possibly overkill- 1/4 tsp might be more accurate, but I had no scale to measure; should be 1/2 tsp according to the conversion [[https://blog.modernistpantry.com/recipes/temptingly-tender-turkey-roulade/|here]])
  * 2 Tbsp soy sauce (or perhaps worcestershire sauce)
  * 1/2 cup boiling water
