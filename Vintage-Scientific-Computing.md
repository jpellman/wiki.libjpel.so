Vintage Scientific Computing
============================

I'm using this page to track pages related to the intersection of two of my interests: scientific computing and retrocomputing. Together, these interests make a pretty niche topic

MATLAB
------

Here are some posts on the history of MATLAB from the official [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com) blog:

-   [Wilkinson and Reinsch Handbook on Linear Algebra](https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2017/12/04/wilkinson-and-reinsch-handbook-on-linear-algebra/)

-   [MultiMATLAB](https://web.archive.org/web/19970613211827/http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Software/MultiMATLAB/) - Interesting for the large number of MATLAB to C compilers it cites.

SAS

SPSS
----

-   The introduction to [SPSS: statistical package for the social sciences](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1214612) (ISBN: 0070465312) has a lot of historical context for the development of SPSS
