== Description ==

My router does not have a cute name.  It is a [[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RYYZZS/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1|WNR3500Lv2]].  It's connected to the interwebz via my [[ArrisSurfboard]] cable modem.  The most notable thing about this router is that I've installed [[https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WNR3500L|dd-wrt]] on it.  This means that, in addition to providing me with wonderful streaming movies, e-mails, games and other web goodness it provides:

 * Static allocation for addresses using DHCP
 * Custom DNS entries between local IPs and domains (currently using the .so TLD because I like it and no one else really uses it) provided by [[|http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.htmlDNSMasq]].
 * VPN to my apartment via [[https://openvpn.net/|OpenVPN Server]]

== Configuration Backup ==

I've exported a copy of my configuration and put it at ''/home/jpellman/Documents/Backups'' on [[maxwell]].  This configuration changes infrequently enough that I plan on backing it up on an ad-hoc basis after major changes are made.

== Plans ==

I don't have any major plans at the moment because I'm boring like that.
