The libjpel.so Wiki
===================

This is the personal Wiki of John Pellman. He is mostly using this as a CMS/revision control system for snippets of information he gleans and various notes for certifications / real-world situations. And maybe he'll have some time for a little science as well.

Interesting starting points:

-   [RecentChanges](../RecentChanges): what has John been doing?
-   [Certifications](../Certifications)
-   [CognitiveScience](../CognitiveScience)

This wiki is powered by [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/).
