libjpel.so Wiki
===============

This is the personal Wiki of John Pellman. I'm mostly using this as a CMS/revision control system for snippets of information I glean and various notes for certifications / situations.

Interesting starting points:

-   [RecentChanges](../RecentChanges): see where people are currently working
-   [WikiSandBox](../WikiSandBox): feel free to change this page and experiment with editing
-   [FindPage](../FindPage): find some content, explore the wiki
-   [HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax](../HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax): quick access to wiki markup

How to use this site
--------------------

A Wiki is a collaborative site, anyone can contribute and share:

-   Edit any page by pressing **[[GetText(Edit)]]\_** at the top or the bottom of the page
-   Create a link to another page with joined capitalized words (like [WikiSandBox](../WikiSandBox)) or with `[[words in brackets]]`
-   Search for page titles or text within pages using the search box at the top of any page
-   See [HelpForBeginners](../HelpForBeginners) to get you going, [HelpContents](../HelpContents) for all help pages.

To learn more about what a [WikiWikiWeb](../WikiWikiWeb) is, read about [WhyWikiWorks](../wiki:MoinMoin:WhyWikiWorks) and the [WikiNature](../wiki:MoinMoin:WikiNature).

This wiki is powered by [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/).
