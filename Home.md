The libjpel.so Wiki
===================

This is the personal Wiki of John Pellman. He is mostly using this as a CMS/revision control system for snippets of information he gleans and various notes for certifications (should he choose to pursue them) and real-world situations. The main role that he envisions for this wiki is to aid him in remembering what he learns by acting as a canvas to organize his thoughts. This is helpful because [elaborative processing increases recall](../Memory). Aside from technical notes, he hopes that he'll have some time for a little science as well.

Interesting starting points:

-   [RecentChanges](../RecentChanges): what has John been doing?
-   Certifications
-   [CognitiveScience](../CognitiveScience)
-   [AcademicComputing](../AcademicComputing)
-   [ScientificComputing](../ScientificComputing)
-   [OpenScience](../OpenScience)
