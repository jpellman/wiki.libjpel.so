History
=======

In addition to Retrocomputing_ and VintageScientificComputing_, I have an interest in history more broadly.  Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.  Below I list some fun resources related to this interest.

Geography
---------

* `NYPL Surveyor`_ : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical locations by giving them an associated geolocation.  Currently only scoped to NYC.

* `NYPL Warper`_ : A crowdsourced georectification tool.

* `80s.nyc`_

Retroscaping
------------

According to Wiktionary_ the noun *retroscape* refers to:

::

   A landscape or setting filled with things from the past.

In the spirit of my opening remarks, I propose to use *retroscape* as a verb to refer to the recreation of a historical setting using virtual reality and historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc).
