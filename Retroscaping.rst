Retroscaping
============

In addition to Retrocomputing_ and VintageScientificComputing_, I have an interest in history more broadly.  Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.  

I propose to use the noun *retroscape* ("A landscape or setting filled with things from the past." according to Wiktionary_) as a verb to refer to such virtual reconstructions. I believe in using historical data aggregated from multiple sources (archives, historical societies, flea markets, cartographers, etc) to re-animate humanity's collective past.

Below I list links related to the fields and tools that are most necessary to facilitate this interest.

.. contents:: :depth: 2

Geography
---------

* `NYPL Surveyor`_ : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical photographs by giving them an associated geolocation.  Currently only scoped to NYC.

* `NYPL Warper`_ : A crowdsourced georectification tool.

* `USGS Topographic Maps`_ 

* `USGS Historical Topographic Maps`_ (also here_

Photogrammetry
--------------

Photogrammetry is the science/engineering/art of generating 3d objects by inferring their shape from 2d photos.

* `Photogrammetry Subreddit`_

* `Introduction to Photogrammetry`_ by T. Schenck

* `Recommendations for intro to photogrammetry`_

* Meshroom_

Photography
-----------

* NYPL Surveyor (see above)

* `80s.nyc`_

* `Collection of Stereoscopic views`_

360 Degree Photography
----------------------

* Google Jump used to seem pretty cool, until `Google's ADHD kicked in`_

* VR180_ is Google's latest venture (because I guess the full 360 degrees was too much to ask)

* I stand by my trusty Ricoh Theta V.

Conversion of Illustrations and Grayscale Photographs to Photorealistic 3d Models
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* DeOldify_

Related Examples from Hollywood
-------------------------------

* `Motherless Brooklyn's recreation of Penn Station`_
