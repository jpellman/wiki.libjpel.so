History
=======

In addition to Retrocomputing_ and VintageScientificComputing_, I have an interest in history more broadly.  Specifically, I am interested in historical reconstruction (a la the holodeck in Star Trek: TNG) and the potential of VR to help facilitate accurate depictions of past places and cultures.  Below I list some fun resources related to this interest.

Geotagging
----------

* `NYPL Surveyor`_ : A crowdsourced tool that allows you to enrich the metadata of historical locations by giving them an associated geolocation.  Currently only scoped to NYC.
